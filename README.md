# rcendactgen
Red Canary Endpoint Activity Generator

## Building Project

- This project was written in .NET 6 on a MacOS machine. You will not need the .NET 6 dependency in order to run the program (verified with ubuntu in a docker container) but you will need it in order to run the source code.
- Inside the directory where you extracted the source code run `dotnet build`
- Then inside the same directory run the following command: `dotnet run --project src/rcendactgen.Main`
